# `System.Web` adapters for ASP.NET Core

This project provides a collection of adapters that help migrating from `System.Web.dll` based ASP.NET projects to ASP.NET Core projects. The adapters currently include:

- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters`: Subset of the APIs from `System.Web.dll` backed by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http` types
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.CoreServices`: Support for adding services to ASP.NET Core applications to enable migration efforts
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.FrameworkServices`: Support for adding services to ASP.NET Framework applications to enable migration efforts
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.Abstractions`: A collection of abstractions shared between the ASP.NET Core and .NET Framework implementations, such as session serialization interfaces.

These adapters help enable large scale, incremental migration from ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core. For more details on incremental migration from ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core, see [Incremental ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core Migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/migration/inc/overview).

## Get started

Use the [Get started with incremental ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/inc/start) guide in the docs to start using the `System.Web` adapters as part of an incremental migration from ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core.

## Set up

The following steps are needed to use the `System.Web` adapters with an ASP.NET project:

1. *Optional for nightly adapter builds*: Set up `NuGet.config` to point to the CI feed:
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <configuration>
     <packageSources>
       <!--To inherit the global NuGet package sources remove the <clear/> line below -->
       <clear />
       <add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
       <add key=".NET Libraries Daily" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-libraries/nuget/v3/index.json" />
     </packageSources>
   </configuration>
   ```
2. Install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters` to supporting libraries
   - Class libraries can target .NET Standard 2.0 if desired which will ensure you are using the shared surface area
   - If you find that there's still some missing APIs, you may cross-compile with .NET Framework to maintain that behavior and handle it in .NET core in some other way
   - There should be no manual changes to enable using supported surface area of the adapters. If a member is not found, it is not currently supported on ASP.NET Core
3. Install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.CoreServices` to your ASP.NET Core application
4. Install `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SystemWebAdapters.FrameworkServices` to your ASP.NET Framework application
   - The package installation will add a new module to your `web.config`. This module handles any customizations that are required to help migrate to .NET Core. See [this](docs/framework.md) for details on what is available here.
5. For your ASP.NET Core application:
   - Register the adapter services:
     ```csharp
     builder.Services.AddSystemWebAdapters();
     ```
   - Add the middleware after routing but before endpoints (if present);
     ```csharp
     app.UseSystemWebAdapters();
     ```
   - For additional configuration, please see the [configuration](./docs/core.md) section

## Supported Targets

- .NET 6.0: This will implement the adapters against ASP.NET Core `HttpContext`. This will provide the following:
  - Conversions between ASP.NET Core `HttpContext` and `System.Web` adapter `HttpContext` (with appropriate caching so it will not cause perf hits for GC allocations)
  - Default implementations against `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpContext`
  - Services that can be implemented to override some functionality such as session/caching/etc that may need to be customized to match experience.
- .NET Standard 2.0: This will essentially be a reference assembly. There will be no constructors for the types as ASP.NET Core will construct them based on their `HttpContext` and on framework there are already other constructors. However, this will allow class libraries to target .NET Standard instead of needing to multi-target which will then require everything it depends on to multi-target.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2: This will type forward the adapter classes to `System.Web` so that they can be unified and enable libraries built against .NET Standard 2.0 to run on .NET Framework instances.

## Known Limitations

Below are some of the limitations of the APIs in the adapters. These are usually due to building off of types used in ASP.NET Core that cannot fully implement the shape of the API in  ASP.NET Framework. In the future, analyzers may be used to flag usage to recommend better patterns.

- A number of APIs in `System.Web.HttpContext` are exposed as `NameValueCollection` instances. In order to reduce copying, many of these are implemented on ASP.NET Core using the core containers. This makes it so that for many of these collections, `Get(int)` (and any API that requires that such as `.Keys` or `.GetEnumerator()`) are unavailable as most of the containers in ASP.NET Core (such as `IHeaderDictionary`) does not have the ability to index by position.
