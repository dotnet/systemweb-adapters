## Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as:

* [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft)
* [Azure](https://github.com/Azure)
* [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet)
* [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet)
* [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin)
* [our GitHub organizations](https://opensource.microsoft.com/).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc751383(v=technet.10)), please report it to us as described in the following section.

## Reporting Security Issues

***Please do not report security vulnerabilities*** through public sites such as GitHub issues.

Rather than reporting in public, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key. You can download our PGP key from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pgp-key-msrc).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you don't, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc).

Please include as much of the requested information listed below that you can provide to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue, e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.
  * Full paths of source files related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code such as tag,branch,commit or direct URL.
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue.
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code, if possible.
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue.

This information helps us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. See our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://microsoft.com/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd).
